                    My name is Jimmy Stone. Iâ€™m originally from a small 
                    town in Minnesota and moved to Lawrence Kansas three years ago to follow my wife 
                    who was accepted into a doctoral program at the University of Kansas for clinical psychology. 
                    We have a 13 month old daughter who every day is learning abilities and is growing. It has been so much 
                    fun to watch her grow and explorer.
                    I am a huge sports fan, the biggest of all of being the Minnesota Vikings. I love to watch football, college and professional, on the weekends. Moving down to Lawrence I have gained a new appreciation for college basketball. I also enjoy playing video games on my PS4 and Nintendo switch and am a huge Harry Potter nerd.
